This `template` is a stripped-down version of Lee Robinson's open sourced site [Leerob.io](https://leerob.io)

While the site is slick all in itself, it contains integrations with Twitter, Youtube, Gumroad etc., which many would not need on their blog, and hence this template.

### What has been kept?
